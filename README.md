## Project Overview

- **FakeStore API:** I integrated the FakeStore API for data retrieval, populating the online store with product information to simulate an e-commerce catalog.

- **Key Pages:** The web application includes several key pages:
  - **Landing Page:** Welcomes users to the online store and provides an overview of available products.
  - **Login Page:** Allows registered users to log in.
  - **Registration Page:** Allows new users to create an account.
  - **Product Pages:** Individual pages for each product, displaying detailed information, pricing, descriptions, and sizing.

## Deployment
I managed the development process and tracked tasks using Trello, ensuring a structured and organized workflow. The website is successfully deployed and hosted on Netlify, ensuring fast and reliable access for visitors.
